title: Install latest Geany on Ubuntu
---

I tried all these snazzy IDE's, but [Geany](www.geany.org) remains the development editor of my choice.
It is lightweight, really fast **and never in your way**. Especially the integrated terminal is a killer feature.

Unfortunately the Software Centre for Ubuntu 14.04 offers only [version 1.23.1](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/geany/). The terminal in this version seems to have serious issues with Unity, breaking down frequently and not responding to the right-click commands. I dare to say "Unity" because the very same version works well on Mint 17.1/Cinnamon.

1 - Get rid of buggy Geany

```bash
sudo apt-get purge geany
```

2 - Add geany-dev ppa and pull latest stable version:

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:geany-dev/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install geany
```

Plugins:
--------

* use `sudo apt-get install geany-plugins` for bulk install
* use `apt-cache search geany` for a list for available plugins. Note that this list might not be complete (see example below)
* use `sudo apt-get install geany-plugin-<plugin name>` for dedicated install

I noticed that the [markdown plugin](http://plugins.geany.org/markdown.html) wasn't visible in the bulk-plugin list for this version.
Whatever the reasons are for this, it works well with the current version (1.2.4) and I was able to force-install it manually.

```bash
# List available plugins
apt-cache search geany

...

# Uh, no markdown listed! - install anyway
sudo apt-get install geany-plugin-markdown
```

MISC:
-----------
Adjust "External open" command for the FileBrowser and the excellent [TreeBrowser](http://plugins.geany.org/treebrowser.html) plugin. Tell Geany to use Nautilus instead of Explorer(!).

* Edit > Plugin Preferences:
* Set "External open" command to: `nautilus "%d"`
