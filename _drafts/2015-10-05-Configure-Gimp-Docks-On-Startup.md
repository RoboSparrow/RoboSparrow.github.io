title: Gimp 2.8, Save dock configuration

I started to turn away from the Adobe Creative $$$uite when they took over took over [macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia) and thus established a Monoploy in the CS market.

If you dont mind climbing an initial learning curve, you can do high-end designs with OpenSource programs and be also productive.
Here is my current CreativeSuite (Ubuntu):

 * [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) for image editing,
 * [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for Vector graphics,
 * [Rawtherapee](rawtherapee.com/) for RAW processing
 * [Scribus](www.scribus.net/) for print layouts
